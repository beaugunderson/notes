- took the plunge on roam after checking out everything in the [awesome knowledge management](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/awesome-knowledge-management) repo
    - the only other real contenders were [foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) and [notion](notion.so)
- brainstorming [things to write](<things to write.md>)
- saw [futureland](https://futureland.tv/) the other day; made a note to check it out--still not sure what it is but it looks like a tool for tracking progress on projects... mostly interesting because of the deliberate air of [mystery](<mystery.md>) it uses
- one of the reasons i chose roam was because of the potential for collaboration, as i was thinking about when i [tweeted]([tweets](<tweets.md>)) this out:

    - do you want to [collaborate](<collaborate.md>)?
- imported the (almost) exhaustive list of [interests](<interests.md>) i've been working on recently; sonya and i had a brief conversation and i responded with this [tweet]([tweets](<tweets.md>))

- made a [music diary](<music diary.md>)
