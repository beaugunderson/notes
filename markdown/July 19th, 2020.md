- did a #[[mountain bike]] [ride](https://www.strava.com/activities/3788372295/overview) (ccc trail in north bend, wa)
    - trail was a bit overgrown, had one decent view (of russian butte), lots of big creek crossings... i opted not to do the reverse and instead took the road back to the car
- i [tweeted]([[tweets]]) that i'd be doing tutor hours on [[July 13th, 2020]] and got my first signup tonight
